# Welcome to my second React project!

This project was created as a way for me to familiarize myself with React hooks, specifically useContext and useReducer.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a simple Expense Tracker App using React hooks. The application allows users to add expenses and income. It displays the total expenses and incomes and also the balance. The use of hooks allows for a more streamlined and efficient codebase.

## Technologies Used

* React
* JavaScript
* CSS

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

* index.js: The main entry point for the application.
* App.js: The main component for the application.
* context: A directory that contains the GlobalState.js and the AppReducer.js files.
* GlobalState.js: A file that creates a global state and exports a provider and a consumer for that state.
* AppReducer.js: A reducer file that handles the state changes for the Expense tracker app.
* components: A directory that contains all of the child components for the application, including Header.js, Balance.js, Transaction.js, TransactionList.js, AddTransaction.js and IncomeExpense.js.
* index.css: The CSS stylesheet for the application.

## What I Learned

Through working on this project, I gained a strong understanding of React hooks, specifically useContext and useReducer. I learned about the benefits of using hooks, including the ability to manage state and avoid prop drilling. I also learned how to create and use contexts and reducers, which are powerful tools for managing state in larger applications.

## Conclusion

This project was a great way for me to continue building my skills with React and explore more advanced topics like hooks. I am excited to continue working with React and building more complex applications using these tools.
